# Softmax-Regression
Implementation for Softmax Regression From Scratch, then comparing with Sklearn Logistic Regression

Project: 

Implement and train Softmax Regression with mini-batch SGD and early stopping.

The expected outcome.

Implement Softmax Regression Model.
Implement mini-batch SGD.
The training should support early stopping.
Train and evaluate the model with cross-validation. The evaluation metric is the accuracy.
Retrain the model with early stopping.
